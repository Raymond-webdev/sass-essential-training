<h1> Sass-Essential-Training</h1>
<p>LinkedIn learning sass fundamental training course
I am using a SASS course on LinkedIn Learning to learn the fundamentals of Synatically Awesome Stylesheets (Sass) a modern web development language that helps you write CSS better, faster and with more advanced features. The instructor shows us the best way to install Sass and work with its main features: variables, nesting, partilas and mixins. Plus learn how to use SassScript to create complex functions from Sass lists and control statements.</p>

<p>Duration: 1h 19m | Beginner | Released: 3/3/2022.</p>

<h2>Why This Course?</h2>

<p>I am studying this online training course as once I have completed the course the SASS skills will enable to me to complete certain projects in software engineering at a more efficient manner.</p>
<p>We use SASS rather than CSS because the syntax is lean which makes our code more efficient.
In programming best practice we adhere to the principal of DRY (Do not repeat yourself).
By following this best practice we are limiting the number of bugs in pur code base.
