//Lists can be used to create an array type object that helps you go through a group of items easily.
//You can create them by using either commas or spaces and also use optional brackets or parentheses.
//SCSS arrays are number 1 indexed so the first element is element number one unlike in JavaScript which is element number 0.


//By using the #{nth($myArray, 1)}, it takes me to the first elemnt which is element 1 (primary)
$myArray: primary secondary warning "item info";
/* #{nth($myArray, 1)} */

//It taks the second element which is (secondary)
$myArray: primary, secondary, warning, "item info";
/* #{nth($myArray, 2)} */

//It takes the third element which is (warning)
$myArray: (primary, secondary, warning, "item info");
/* #{nth($myArray, 3)} */

//It takes the fourth element which is (item info)
$myArray: [primary, secondary, warning, "item info" ];
/* #{nth($myArray, 4)} */

//By using negative indexes, it will go to the end of the array selecting the last item.
$myArray: [primary, secondary, warning, "item info" ];
/* #{nth($myArray, -1)} */
