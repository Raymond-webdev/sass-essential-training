# List Operations

The list functions are used to access values in a list, combine lists, and add items to lists. Sass lists are immutable (they cannot change). So, the list functions that return a list, will return a new list, and not change the original list.
Sass has lists, which is a similar data structure to an Array or an Object

## Example

$myList1: (primary, secondary, warning);
$myList2: [red, orange, green, blue, black];
