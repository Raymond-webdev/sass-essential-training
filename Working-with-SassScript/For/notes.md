# The @for directive

The @for directive calculates from one number to another upwards or downwards and checks one block for each number between each one.
The @for gives you a way to iterate through a series of numbers.

The @ format looks like this:

@for <var> to | through <expression> {...} 

You use the "to" keyword if you want it not to include the last number so for example use (1, 2, 3), it would just give you number 1 and 2 but not three.
You use the "through" keyword if you want it to go all the way to the end of the number so it includes that last number.
